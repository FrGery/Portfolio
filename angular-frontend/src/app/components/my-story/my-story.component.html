          <h3>Where it all started</h3>
          <p>Back in <span class="highlight-green">1995</span>, my parents generated me with early AI — running on limited hardware but infinite curiosity.<p>
          <p>As soon as I gained consciousness, I found myself fascinated by <span class="highlight-green">technology</span>. <p>
          <p>Tinkering with <span class="highlight-skill">hardware</span> and <span class="highlight-skill">software</span>
          became my hobby, and before long, I was that <span class="highlight-green">Tech-Guy</span> everyone called when something beeped, blinked, or broke.<p>

          <h3>Studies</h3>
          <p>In High-School, I attended an English preparatory program and graduated with an
            <span class="highlight-green">advanced</span> level in <span class="highlight-skill">Biology</span> and earned a
            <span class="highlight-skill">B2 English</span> language certificate. At that time, I hadn’t yet realized that I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
          <p>Later, I studied <span class="highlight-green">Hospitality</span> and <span class="highlight-green">Economics</span> at <span class="highlight-green">Budapest Business School</span> , where I earned my degree in
            <span class="highlight-skill">Economics</span>.</p>
          <p>After several years of work experience, I eventually found my true path and completed a Full-Stack Developer bootcamp.

          <h3>Coding found me</h3>
          <p>
            I love turning ideas into well-structured code – and I’m always
            exploring better patterns, tools, and practices.
