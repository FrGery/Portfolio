          <h3>Where it all started</h3>
          <p>Back in <span class="highlight-green">1995</span>, my parents generated me with early AI — running on
            limited hardware but infinite curiosity.
          <p>
          <p>As soon as I gained consciousness, I found myself fascinated by <span
            class="highlight-green">technology</span>.
          <p>
          <p>Tinkering with <span class="highlight-skill">hardware</span> and <span
            class="highlight-skill">software</span>
            became my hobby, and before long, I was that <span class="highlight-green">Tech-Guy</span> everyone called
            when something beeped, blinked, or broke.

          <h3>Studies</h3>
          <p>– In High-School, I attended an English preparatory program and graduated with an
            <span class="highlight-green">advanced</span> level in <span class="highlight-skill">Biology</span> and
            earned a
            <span class="highlight-skill">B2 English</span> language certificate. At that time, I hadn’t yet realized
            that I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
          <p>– Later, I studied <span class="highlight-green">Hospitality</span> and <span class="highlight-green">Economics</span>
            at <span class="highlight-green">Budapest Business School</span> , where I earned my degree in
            <span class="highlight-skill">Economics</span>.</p>
          <p>– After several years of work experience, I eventually found my true path and completed a Full-Stack
            Developer bootcamp.

          <h3>Hospitality Work Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve worn many hats — <span class="highlight-green">Cook</span>, <span
            class="highlight-green">Barista</span>, and eventually <span class="highlight-green">Sous-Chef</span>.
            I worked across various environments, from hotels to restaurants, but the most defining 13 years of my
            career were at <span class="highlight-green">Friedmann Restaurant</span> in Budaörs.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s where I grew from a beginner cook into a Chef.
            I took part in several <span class="highlight-green">National Competitions</span>, honed my craft, and
            learned what it truly means to <span class="highlight-green">work in</span> — and later <span
            class="highlight-green">lead</span> — a <span class="highlight-green">team</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            During those years, I developed key skills I still rely on today:
            <span class="highlight-skill">leadership</span>, <span class="highlight-skill">communication</span>, <span
            class="highlight-skill">organization</span>, <span class="highlight-skill">mentoring</span>, <span
            class="highlight-skill">precision</span>, and <span class="highlight-skill">efficiency</span> — always
            keeping an eye on the big picture without losing sight of the details.

          <h3>Life Rebooted</h3>

          <p>
            Eventually, I became a <span class="highlight-green">husband</span> and a <span class="highlight-green">father</span>.
            Life took an unexpected turn, and I went on <span class="highlight-green">parental leave</span> with my
            daughter — thank God my wife worked from home!
            Long story short: this was <span class="highlight-green">my time</span>. I knew I might never get another
            chance to learn something new, so I jumped back into <span class="highlight-green">IT</span> — mostly at
            night. 😄
          </p>

          <p>
            I completed a <span class="highlight-green">1-year Full Stack Developer Bootcamp</span> at <span
            class="highlight-green">Progmasters</span>, where I trained with real-world projects and modern
            technologies.
            It was both fantastic and challenging — exactly what I needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fun fact: from time to time, I still helped out at the restaurant where I used to be a Chef — fixing their
            computers and keeping their Linux system alive.
            I still love cooking, but I’ve realized my true path continues as a <span
            class="highlight-skill">developer</span>.

          <h3>Me as a Junior developer</h3>

          <p>
            After completing the course, our school gave us the opportunity to keep working on their own full-stack
            platform.
            We organized ourselves into small <span class="highlight-green">Scrum teams</span> and started working in a
            truly <span class="highlight-green">Agile environment</span> — complete with sprints, stand-ups, and real
            <span class="highlight-green">demos presented to partner companies</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’re still developing this project to this day — continuously <span
            class="highlight-skill"> improving</span>, <span class="highlight-skill">fixing</span>, and <span
            class="highlight-skill">learning</span> as we go,
            until we all find our first professional placement.
            It’s been an incredible experience, and I’ve learned a <span class="highlight-green"> gret deal</span>
            through real teamwork and real challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ll always be grateful to <span class="highlight-green">Progmasters</span> for this opportunity.
            I’ve never felt more <span class="highlight-green">ready</span> to join a serious project and contribute as
            a Junior Developer.
